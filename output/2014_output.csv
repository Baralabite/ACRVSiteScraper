Mehrtash T Harandi, Mathieu Salzmann, Sadeep Jayasumana, Richard Hartley, Hongdong Li	2014/9/6	None	Abstract Modeling videos and image-sets as linear subspaces has proven beneficial for many visual recognition tasks. However, it also incurs challenges arising from the fact that linear subspaces do not obey Euclidean geometry, but lie on a special type of Riemannian manifolds known as Grassmannian. To leverage the techniques developed for Euclidean spaces (eg, support vector machines) with subspaces, several recent studies have proposed to embed the Grassmannian into a Hilbert space by making use of a positive definite  ...	41
Fumin Shen, Chunhua Shen, Rhys Hill, Anton van den Hengel, Zhenmin Tang	2014/9/30	None	Abstract Minimization of the L∞ L∞ norm, which can be viewed as approximately solving the non-convex least median estimation problem, is a powerful method for outlier removal and hence robust regression. However, current techniques for solving the problem at the heart of L∞ L∞ norm minimization are slow, and therefore cannot be scaled to large problems. A new method for the minimization of the L∞ L∞ norm is presented here, which provides a speedup of multiple orders of magnitude for data with high dimension. This  ...	11
Chunhua Shen, Junae Kim, Fayao Liu, Lei Wang, Anton van den Hengel	2014	None	Abstract: Distance metric learning is of fundamental interest in machine learning because the employed distance metric can significantly affect the performance of many learning methods. Quadratic Mahalanobis metric learning is a popular approach to the problem, but typically requires solving a semidefinite programming (SDP) problem, which is computationally expensive. The worst case complexity of solving an SDP problem involving a matrix variable of size D× D with O (D) linear constraints is about O (D 6.5) using interior- ...	16
Trung Thanh Pham, Tat-Jun Chin, Konrad Schindler, David Suter	2014/10	None	Abstract: Recent works on multimodel fitting are often formulated as an energy minimization task, where the energy function includes fitting error and regularization terms, such as low-level spatial smoothness and model complexity. In this paper, we introduce a novel energy with high-level geometric priors that consider interactions between geometric models, such that certain preferred model configurations may be induced. We argue that in many applications, such prior geometric properties are available and should be fruitfully  ...	11
Chamira US Edussooriya, Donald G Dansereau, Len T Bruton, Panajotis Agathoklis	2015/4/15	None	Abstract Five-dimensional (5-D) light field video (LFV)(also known as plenoptic video) is a more powerful form of representing information of dynamic scenes compared to conventional three-dimensional (3-D) video. In this paper, the 5-D spectrum of an object in an LFV is derived for the important practical case of objects moving with constant velocity and at constant depth. In particular, it is shown that the region of support (ROS) of the 5-D spectrum is a skewed 3-D hyperfan in the 5-D frequency domain, with the degree of skew  ...	13
Hanxi Li, Yi Li, Fatih Porikli	2016/4	None	Abstract: Deep neural networks, albeit their great success on feature learning in various computer vision tasks, are usually considered as impractical for online visual tracking, because they require very long training time and a large number of training samples. In this paper, we present an efficient and very robust tracking algorithm using a single convolutional neural network (CNN) for learning effective feature representations of the target object in a purely online manner. Our contributions are multifold. First, we introduce  ...	33
Chamira US Edussooriya, Len T Bruton, Panajotis Agathoklis	2015/8/24	None	Abstract: The spectrum of an object moving in 5-D light field videos (also known as plenoptic videos) with constant velocity and at non-constant depth is analyzed. Based on this analysis, a novel 5-D IIR adaptive depth-velocity filter is proposed for enhancing such objects. The time-variant coefficients of the proposed 5-D IIR adaptive depth-velocity filter are derived in closed form. Numerical simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed filter compared to 3-D IIR adaptive velocity filters and 4-D IIR adaptive depth filters.	2
Gao Zhu, Fatih Porikli, Yansheng Ming, Hongdong Li	2015/1/5	None	Abstract: This paper presents a novel and reliable tracking-by detection method for image regions that undergo affine transformations such as translation, rotation, scale, dilatation and shear deformations, which span the six degrees of freedom of motion. Our method takes advantage of the intrinsic Lie group structure of the 2D affine motion matrices and imposes this motion structure on a kernelized structured output SVM classifier that provides an appearance based prediction function to directly estimate the object transformation  ...	7
Jiaolong Yang, Hongdong Li, Yunde Jia	2014/9/6	None	Abstract In this paper, we extend the globally optimal “rotation space search” method [11] to essential matrix estimation in the presence of feature mismatches or outliers. The problem is formulated as inlier-set cardinality maximization, and solved via branch-and-bound global optimization which searches the entire essential manifold formed by all essential matrices. Our main contributions include an explicit, geometrically meaningful essential manifold parametrization using a 5D direct product space of a solid 2D disk and a solid 3D ball, as  ...	14
Yi Wang, Pierre-Marc Jodoin, Fatih Porikli, Janusz Konrad, Yannick Benezeth, Prakash Ishwar	2014	None	Abstract Change detection is one of the most important low-level tasks in video analytics. In 2012, we introduced the changedetection. net (CDnet) benchmark, a video dataset devoted to the evaluation of change and motion detection approaches. Here, we present the latest release of the CDnet dataset, which includes 22 additional videos (~ 70,000 pixel-wise annotated frames) spanning 5 new categories that incorporate challenges encountered in many surveillance settings. We describe these categories in detail and provide an  ...	152
Ibrahim Saygin Topkaya, Hakan Erdogan, Fatih Porikli	2014/8/26	None	Abstract: We present a people counting system that estimates the number of people in a scene by employing a clustering scheme based on Dirichlet Process Mixture Models (DP-MMs) which takes outputs of a person detector system as input. For each frame, we run a person detector on the frame, take its output as a set of detection areas and define a set of features based on spatial, color and temporal information for each detection. Then using these features, we cluster the detections using DPMMs and Gibbs sampling while having  ...	8
Lingling Tao, Fatih Porikli, René Vidal	2014/9/6	None	Abstract A popular trend in semantic segmentation is to use top-down object information to improve bottom-up segmentation. For instance, the classification scores of the Bag of Features (BoF) model for image classification have been used to build a top-down categorization cost in a Conditional Random Field (CRF) model for semantic segmentation. Recent work shows that discriminative sparse dictionary learning (DSDL) can improve upon the unsupervised K-means dictionary learning method used in the BoF model due to the  ...	4
Niko Sünderhauf, Chris McCool, Ben Upcroft, Tristan Perez	2014	None	Abstract. We present an overview of the QUT plant classification system submitted to LifeCLEF 2014. This system uses generic features extracted from a convolutional neural network previously used to perform general object classification. We examine the effectiveness of these features to perform plant classification when used in combination with an extremely randomised forest. Using this system, with minimal tuning, we obtained relatively good results with a score of 0.249 on the test set of LifeCLEF 2014.	16
Akshay Soni, Jarvis Haupt, Fatih Porikli	2014/5/4	None	Abstract: Many machine learning applications employ a multiclass classification stage that uses multiple binary linear classifiers as building blocks. Among these, commonly used strategies such as one-vs-one classification can require learning a large number of hyperplanes, even when the number of classes to be discriminated among is modest. Further, when the data being classified is inherently high-dimensional, the storage and computational complexity associated with the application of multiple linear classifiers can  ...	0
Hajar Sadeghi Sokeh, Stephen Gould, Jochen Renz	2014	None	Abstract Understanding the activities taking place in a video is a challenging problem in Artificial Intelligence. Complex video sequences contain many activities and involve a multitude of interacting objects. Determining which objects are relevant to a particular activity is the first step in understanding the activity. Indeed many objects in the scene are irrelevant to the main activity taking place. In this work, we consider human-centric activities and look to identify which objects in the scene are involved in the activity. We take an activity- ...	0
Abhishek Singh, Fatih Porikli, Narendra Ahuja	2014	None	Abstract Our goal is to obtain a noise-free, high resolution (HR) image, from an observed, noisy, low resolution (LR) image. The conventional approach of preprocessing the image with a denoising algorithm, followed by applying a super-resolution (SR) algorithm, has an important limitation: Along with noise, some high frequency content of the image (particularly textural detail) is invariably lost during the denoising step. This' denoising loss' restricts the performance of the subsequent SR step, wherein the challenge is to synthesize such  ...	23
Xianbiao Shu, Fatih Porikli, Narendra Ahuja	2014	None	Abstract Low-rank matrix recovery from a corrupted observation has many applications in computer vision. Conventional methods address this problem by iterating between nuclear norm minimization and sparsity minimization. However, iterative nuclear norm minimization is computationally prohibitive for large-scale data (eg, video) analysis. In this paper, we propose a Robust Orthogonal Subspace Learning (ROSL) method to achieve efficient low-rank recovery. Our intuition is a novel rank measure on the low-rank matrix that imposes  ...	27
Qinfeng Shi, Mark Reid, Tiberio Caetano, Anton Van den Hengel, Zhenhua Wang	2015/1	None	Abstract: We propose a novel hybrid loss for multiclass and structured prediction problems that is a convex combination of a log loss for Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) and a multiclass hinge loss for Support Vector Machines (SVMs). We provide a sufficient condition for when the hybrid loss is Fisher consistent for classification. This condition depends on a measure of dominance between labels-specifically, the gap between the probabilities of the best label and the second best label. We also prove Fisher consistency is necessary for  ...	5
Sareh Shirazi, Mehrtash T Harandi, Brian C Lovell, Conrad Sanderson	2014/3/24	None	Abstract: A robust visual tracking system requires an object appearance model that is able to handle occlusion, pose, and illumination variations in the video stream. This can be difficult to accomplish when the model is trained using only a single image. In this paper, we first propose a tracking approach based on affine subspaces (constructed from several images) which are able to accommodate the abovementioned variations. We use affine subspaces not only to represent the object, but also the candidate areas that the object may occupy.  ...	13
Aleksandr V Segal, Ian D Reid	2014/9/14	None	Abstract: In this paper we introduce a new optimization algorithm for networks of switched nonlinear objectives and apply this to the important problem of pose graph estimation for robot localization and mapping. The key insight is to replace the linear solver typically used in Gauss-Newton style methods with hybrid inference over switched discrete/continuous linear Gaussian networks. Since exact inference in these networks is known to be NP-hard, we also propose an approximate inference algorithm for the linearized hybrid networks  ...	2
Inkyu Sa, Stefan Hrabar, Peter Corke	2014/9/14	None	Abstract: We present an approach for the inspection of vertical pole-like infrastructure using a vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) unmanned aerial vehicle and shared autonomy. Inspecting vertical structures, such as light and power distribution poles, is a time consuming, dangerous and expensive task with high operator workload. To address these issues, we propose a VTOL platform that can operate at close-quarters, whilst maintaining a safe stand-off distance and rejecting environmental disturbances. We adopt an Image  ...	17
Patrick Ross, Andrew English, David Ball, Ben Upcroft, Gordon Wyeth, Peter Corke	2014/5/31	None	Abstract: This paper describes a novel obstacle detection system for autonomous robots in agricultural field environments that uses a novelty detector to inform stereo matching. Stereo vision alone erroneously detects obstacles in environments with ambiguous appearance and ground plane such as in broad-acre crop fields with harvested crop residue. The novelty detector estimates the probability density in image descriptor space and incorporates image-space positional understanding to identify potential regions for obstacle detection using  ...	11
Patrick Ross, Andrew English, David Ball, Peter Corke	2014	None	This paper presents a new metric, which we call the lighting variance ratio, for quantifying descriptors in terms of their variance to illumination changes. In many applications it is desirable to have descriptors that are robust to changes in illumination, especially in outdoor environments. The lighting variance ratio is useful for comparing descriptors and determining if a descriptor is lighting invariant enough for a given environment. The metric is analysed across a number of datasets, cameras and descriptors. The results show that the  ...	3
Carl Yuheng Ren, Victor Prisacariu, Olaf Kaehler, Ian Reid, David Murray	2014	None	Abstract: Most current approaches for 3D object tracking rely on distinctive object appearances. While several such trackers can be instantiated to track multiple objects independently, this not only neglects that objects should not occupy the same space in 3D, but also fails when objects have highly similar or identical appearances. In this paper we develop a probabilistic graphical model that accounts for similarity and proximity and leads to robust real-time tracking of multiple objects from RGB-D data, without recourse to bolton  ...	7
Edward Pepperell, Peter I Corke, Michael J Milford	2014/5/31	None	Abstract: This paper presents Sequence Matching Across Route Traversals (SMART); a generally applicable sequence-based place recognition algorithm. SMART provides invariance to changes in illumination and vehicle speed while also providing moderate pose invariance and robustness to environmental aliasing. We evaluate SMART on vehicles travelling at highly variable speeds in two challenging environments; firstly, on an all-terrain vehicle in an off-road, forest track and secondly, using a passenger car traversing an  ...	39
Edward Pepperell, Peter Corke, Michael Milford	2014/12/3	None	Vision-based place recognition involves recognising familiar places despite changes in environmental conditions or camera viewpoint (pose). Existing training-free methods exhibit excellent invariance to either of these challenges, but not both simultaneously. In this paper, we present a technique for condition-invariant place recognition across large lateral platform pose variance for vehicles or robots travelling along routes. Our approach combines sideways facing cameras with a new multi-scale image comparison technique that  ...	8
Álvaro Parra Bustos, Tat-Jun Chin, David Suter	2014/6/23	None	Abstract Recently there has been a surge of interest to use branch-and-bound (bnb) optimisation for 3D point cloud registration. While bnb guarantees globally optimal solutions, it is usually too slow to be practical. A fundamental source of difficulty is the search for the rotation parameters in the 3D rigid transform. In this work, assuming that the translation parameters are known, we focus on constructing a fast rotation search algorithm. With respect to an inherently robust geometric matching criterion, we propose a novel  ...	16
Sakrapee Paisitkriangkrai, Chunhua Shen, Anton van den Hengel	2014/9/6	None	Abstract We propose a simple yet effective approach to the problem of pedestrian detection which outperforms the current state-of-the-art. Our new features are built on the basis of low-level visual features and spatial pooling. Incorporating spatial pooling improves the translational invariance and thus the robustness of the detection process. We then directly optimise the partial area under the ROC curve (pAUC) measure, which concentrates detection performance in the range of most practical importance. The combination of these  ...	68
Carl Olsson, Johannes Ulén, Anders Eriksson	2014	None	Abstract: Stereo matching is an inherently difficult problem due to ambiguous and noisy texture. The non-convexity and non-differentiability makes local linear (or quadratic) approximations poor, thereby preventing the use of standard local descent methods. Therefore recent methods are predominantly based on discretization and/or random sampling of some class of approximating surfaces (eg planes). While these methods are very efficient in generating a rough surface estimate, via either fusion of proposals or label  ...	1
Liam O'Sullivan, Peter Corke	2014/5/31	None	Abstract: We propose and evaluate a novel methodology to identify the rolling shutter parameters of a real camera. We also present a model for the geometric distortion introduced when a moving camera with a rolling shutter views a scene. Unlike previous work this model allows for arbitrary camera motion, including accelerations, is exact rather than a linearization and allows for arbitrary camera projection models, for example fisheye or panoramic. We show the significance of the errors introduced by a rolling shutter for  ...	3
Jie Ni, Tim K Marks, Oncel Tuzel, Fatih Porikli	2014/3/24	None	Abstract: The goal of this research is to identify 3D geometric boundaries in a set of 2D photographs of a static indoor scene under unknown, changing lighting conditions. A 3D geometric boundary is a contour located at a 3D depth discontinuity or a discontinuity in the surface normal. These boundaries can be used effectively for reasoning about the 3D layout of a scene. To distinguish 3D geometric boundaries from 2D texture edges, we analyze the illumination subspace of local appearance at each image location. In indoor time-lapse  ...	0
Behrooz Nasihatkon, Richard Hartley, Jochen Trumpf	2014	None	Abstract We study the theory of projective reconstruction for multiple projections from an arbitrary dimensional projective space into lower-dimensional spaces. This problem is important due to its applications in the analysis of dynamical scenes. The current theory, due to Hartley and Schaffalitzky, is based on the Grassmann tensor, generalizing the ideas of fundamental matrix, trifocal tensor and quadrifocal tensor used in the well-studied case of 3D to 2D projections. We present a theory whose point of departure is the projective  ...	0
Jacinto C Nascimento, Gustavo Carneiro	2014	None	Abstract In this paper, we propose a new methodology for segmenting non-rigid visual objects, where the search procedure is onducted directly on a sparse low-dimensional manifold, guided by the classification results computed from a deep belief network. Our main contribution is the fact that we do not rely on the typical sub-division of segmentation tasks into rigid detection and non-rigid delineation. Instead, the non-rigid segmentation is performed directly, where points in the sparse low-dimensional can be mapped to an  ...	5
Farshid Moussavi, Yu Wang, Peter Lorenzen, Jonathan Oakley, D Russakoff, Stephen Gould	2014/4/29	None	Abstract: Time lapse microscopy has emerged as an important modality for studying early human embryo development. Detection of certain events can provide insight into embryo health and fate. Embryo tracking is challenged by a high dimensional search space, weak features, outliers, occlusions, missing data, multiple interacting deformable targets, changing topology, and a weak motion model. We address these with a data driven approach that uses a rich set of discriminative image and geometric features and their spatiotemporal  ...	3
Timothy Morris, Feras Dayoub, Peter Corke, Gordon Wyeth, Ben Upcroft	2014/2/15	None	Abstract: This paper presents a method to enable a mobile robot working in non-stationary environments to plan its path and localize within multiple map hypotheses simultaneously. The maps are generated using a long-term and short-term memory mechanism that ensures only persistent configurations in the environment are selected to create the maps. In order to evaluate the proposed method, experimentation is conducted in an office environment. Compared to navigation systems that use only one map, our system produces superior  ...	6
Timothy Morris, Feras Dayoub, Peter Corke, Ben Upcroft	2014/9/14	None	Abstract: This paper presents a novel method to rank map hypotheses by the quality of localization they afford. The highest ranked hypothesis at any moment becomes the active representation that is used to guide the robot to its goal location. A single static representation is insufficient for navigation in dynamic environments where paths can be blocked periodically, a common scenario which poses significant challenges for typical planners. In our approach we simultaneously rank multiple map hypotheses by the  ...	1
Timothy L Molloy, Jason J Ford	2014/7/7	None	Abstract: The quick detection of an abrupt unknown change in the conditional distribution of a dependent stochastic process has numerous applications. In this paper, we pose a minimax robust quickest change detection problem for cases where there is uncertainty about the post-change conditional distribution. Our minimax robust formulation is based on the popular Lorden criteria of optimal quickest change detection. Under a condition on the set of possible post-change distributions, we show that the widely known cumulative sum ( ...	3
Timothy L Molloy, Jason J Ford, Luis Mejias	2014	None	This paper proposes new techniques for aircraft shape estimation, passive ranging, and shape-adaptive hidden Markov model filtering which are suitable for a monocular vision-based non-cooperative collision avoidance system. Vision-based passive ranging is an important missing technology that could play a significant role in resolving the sense-and-avoid problem in un-manned aerial vehicles (UAVs); a barrier hindering the wider adoption of UAVs for civilian applications. The feasibility of the pro-posed shape estimation, passive  ...	5
Timothy L Molloy, Jason J Ford	2014/11/17	None	Abstract: Rapid recursive estimation of hidden Markov Model (HMM) parameters is important in applications that place an emphasis on the early availability of reasonable estimates (eg for change detection) rather than the provision of longer-term asymptotic properties (such as convergence, convergence rate, and consistency). In the context of vision-based aircraft (image-plane) heading estimation, this paper suggests and evaluates the short-data estimation properties of 3 recursive HMM parameter estimation techniques (a recursive  ...	1
Michael Milford, Walter Scheirer, Eleonora Vig, Arren Glover, Oliver Baumann, Jason Mattingley, David Cox	2014/5/31	None	Abstract: In this paper we present a novel, condition-invariant place recognition algorithm inspired by recent discoveries in human visual neuroscience. The algorithm combines intolerant but fast low resolution whole image matching with highly tolerant, sub-image patch matching processes. The approach does not require prior training and works on single images, alleviating the need for either a velocity signal or image sequence, differentiating it from current state of the art methods. We conduct an exhaustive set of experiments  ...	16
Michael Milford, Jennifer Firn, James Beattie, Adam Jacobson, Edward Pepperell, Eugene Mason, Michael Kimlin, Matthew Dunbabin	2014	None	In this paper we present research adapting a state of the art condition-invariant robotic place recognition algorithm to the role of automated inter-and intra-image alignment of sensor observations of environmental and skin change over time. The approach involves inverting the typical criteria placed upon navigation algorithms in robotics; we exploit rather than attempt to fix the limited camera viewpoint invariance of such algorithms, showing that approximate viewpoint repetition is realistic in a wide range of environments and medical  ...	4
Michael Milford, Ashley George	2014	None	Abstract Vision-based SLAM is mostly a solved problem providing clear, sharp images can be obtained. However, in outdoor environments a number of factors such as rough terrain, high speeds and hardware limitations can result in these conditions not being met. High speed transit on rough terrain can lead to image blur and under/over exposure, problems that cannot easily be dealt with using low cost hardware. Furthermore, recently there has been a growth in interest in lifelong autonomy for robots, which brings with it the challenge  ...	8
Anton Milan, Rikke Gade, Anthony Dick, Thomas B Moeslund, Ian Reid	2014	None	Abstract. We propose a scheme to explicitly detect and resolve ambiguous situations in multiple target tracking. During periods of uncertainty, our method applies multiple local single target trackers to hypothesise short term tracks. These tracks are combined with the tracks obtained by a global multi-target tracker, if they result in a reduction in the global cost function. Since tracking failures typically arise when targets become occluded, we propose a local data association scheme to maintain the target identities in these situations. We  ...	5
Steven Martin, Peter Corke	2014/5/31	None	Abstract: This paper is concerned with how a localised and energy-constrained robot can maximise its time in the field by taking paths and tours that minimise its energy expenditure. A significant component of a robot's energy is expended on mobility and is a function of terrain traversability. We estimate traversability online from data sensed by the robot as it moves, and use this to generate maps, explore and ultimately converge on minimum energy tours of the environment. We provide results of detailed simulations and parameter studies  ...	6
Stephanie Lowry, Gordon Wyeth, Michael Milford	2014	None	Abstract: Whole image descriptors have been shown to be remarkably robust to perceptual change especially compared to local features. However, whole-image-based localization systems typically rely on heuristic methods for determining appropriate matching thresholds in a particular environment. These environment-specific tuning requirements and the lack of a meaningful interpretation of arbitrary thresholds limit the general applicability of these systems. In this paper we present a Bayesian model of probability for whole-image  ...	10
Stephanie Lowry, Gordon Wyeth, Michael Milford	2014	None	Abstract This paper presents an online, unsupervised training algorithm enabling vision-based place recognition across a wide range of changing environmental conditions such as those caused by weather, seasons, and day-night cycles. The technique applies principal component analysis to distinguish between aspects of a location's appearance that are condition-dependent and those that are condition-invariant. Removing the dimensions associated with environmental conditions produces condition-invariant images that can be  ...	6
Stephanie Lowry, Michael Milford, Gordon Wyeth	2014	None	Abstract: Visual localization in outdoor environments is often hampered by the natural variation in appearance caused by such things as weather phenomena, diurnal fluctuations in lighting, and seasonal changes. Such changes are global across an environment and, in the case of global light changes and seasonal variation, the change in appearance occurs in a regular, cyclic manner. Visual localization could be greatly improved if it were possible to predict the appearance of a particular location at a particular time, based on the  ...	19
Lingqiao Liu, Chunhua Shen, Lei Wang, Anton Van Den Hengel, Chao Wang	2014	None	Abstract Deriving from the gradient vector of a generative model of local features, Fisher vector coding (FVC) has been identified as an effective coding method for image classification. Most, if not all, FVC implementations employ the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to characterize the generation process of local features. This choice has shown to be sufficient for traditional low dimensional local features, eg, SIFT; and typically, good performance can be achieved with only a few hundred Gaussian distributions. However,  ...	41
Buyu Liu, Xuming He, Stephen Gould	2014/3/24	None	Abstract: We address the problem of geometric and semantic consistent video segmentation for outdoor scenes. With no assumption on camera movement, we jointly model the semantic-geometric class of spatio-temporal regions (supervoxels) and geometric scene layout in each frame. Our main contribution is to propose a stage scene model to efficiently capture the dependency between the semantic and geometric labels. We build a unified CRF model on supervoxel labels and stage parameters, and design an alternating  ...	3
Guosheng Lin, Chunhua Shen, Qinfeng Shi, Anton van den Hengel, David Suter	2014/4/6	None	Abstract Supervised hashing aims to map the original features to compact binary codes that are able to preserve label based similarity in the Hamming space. Non-linear hash functions have demonstrated their advantage over linear ones due to their powerful generalization capability. In the literature, kernel functions are typically used to achieve non-linearity in hashing, which achieve encouraging retrieval performance at the price of slow evaluation and training time. Here we propose to use boosted decision trees for achieving non- ...	137
Guosheng Lin, Chunhua Shen, Jianxin Wu	2014/9/6	None	Abstract Hashing has proven a valuable tool for large-scale information retrieval. Despite much success, existing hashing methods optimize over simple objectives such as the reconstruction error or graph Laplacian related loss functions, instead of the performance evaluation criteria of interest—multivariate performance measures such as the AUC and NDCG. Here we present a general framework (termed StructHash) that allows one to directly optimize multivariate performance measures. The resulting optimization problem can  ...	16
Hanxi Li, Yi Li, Fatih Porikli	2014/11/1	None	Abstract Deep neural networks, albeit their great success on feature learning in various computer vision tasks, are usually considered as impractical for online visual tracking because they require very long training time and a large number of training samples. In this work, we present an efficient and very robust online tracking algorithm using a single Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for learning effective feature representations of the target object over time. Our contributions are multifold: First, we introduce a novel  ...	31
Bo Li, Yuchao Dai, Mingyi He, Anton van den Hengel	2014/7/9	None	Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel method for articulated trajectory reconstruction from a monocular image sequence. We propose a relaxation-based objective function, which utilises both smoothness and geometric constraints, posing articulated trajectory reconstruction as a non-linear optimization problem. The main advantage of this approach is that it remains the re-constructive power of the original algorithm, while improving its robustness to the inevitable noise in the data. Furthermore, we present an effective  ...	0
Obadiah Lam, Feras Dayoub, Ruth Schulz, Peter Corke	2014/12/2	None	This paper evaluates the performance of different text recognition techniques for a mobile robot in an indoor (university campus) environment. We compared four different methods: our own approach using existing text detection methods (Minimally Stable Extremal Regions detector and Stroke Width Transform) combined with a convolutional neural network, two modes of the open source program Tesseract, and the experimental mobile app Google Goggles. The results show that a convolutional neural network combined with the Stroke  ...	3
Laurent Kneip, Hongdong Li, Yongduek Seo	2014/9/6	None	Abstract A large number of absolute pose algorithms have been presented in the literature. Common performance criteria are computational complexity, geometric optimality, global optimality, structural degeneracies, and the number of solutions. The ability to handle minimal sets of correspondences, resulting solution multiplicity, and generalized cameras are further desirable properties. This paper presents the first PnP solution that unifies all the above desirable properties within a single algorithm. We compare our result to state-of-the ...	23
Laurent Kneip, Hongdong Li	2014	None	Abstract We present a novel solution to compute the relative pose of a generalized camera. Existing solutions are either not general, have too high computational complexity, or require too many correspondences, which impedes an efficient or accurate usage within Ransac schemes. We factorize the problem as a low-dimensional, iterative optimization over relative rotation only, directly derived from well-known epipolar constraints. Common generalized cameras often consist of camera clusters, and give rise to omni-directional landmark  ...	16
Pan Ji, Yiran Zhong, Hongdong Li, Mathieu Salzmann	2014/10/27	None	Abstract: The problems of motion segmentation and face clustering can be addressed in a framework of subspace clustering methods. In this paper, we tackle the more general problem of clustering data points lying in a union of low-dimensional linear (or affine) subspaces, which can be naturally applied in motion segmentation and face clustering. For data points drawn from linear (or affine) subspaces, we propose a novel algorithm called Null Space Clustering (NSC), utilizing the null space of the data matrix to construct the  ...	2
Pan Ji, Mathieu Salzmann, Hongdong Li	2014	None	Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the problem of clustering data points drawn from a union of linear (or affine) subspaces. To this end, we introduce an efficient subspace clustering algorithm that estimates dense connections between the points lying in the same subspace. In particular, instead of following the standard compressive sensing approach, we formulate subspace clustering as a Frobenius norm minimization problem, which inherently yields denser con-nections between the data points. While in the noise-free case we rely on the  ...	11
Pan Ji, Hongdong Li, Mathieu Salzmann, Yuchao Dai	2014/9/6	None	Abstract Motion segmentation can be addressed as a subspace clustering problem, assuming that the trajectories of interest points are known. However, establishing point correspondences is in itself a challenging task. Most existing approaches tackle the correspondence estimation and motion segmentation problems separately. In this paper, we introduce an approach to performing motion segmentation without any prior knowledge of point correspondences. We formulate this problem in terms of Partial Permutation Matrices  ...	11
Sadeep Jayasumana, Richard Hartley, Mathieu Salzmann, Hongdong Li, Mehrtash Harandi	2014/6/24	None	Abstract We tackle the problem of optimizing over all possible positive definite radial kernels on Riemannian manifolds for classification. Kernel methods on Riemannian manifolds have recently become increasingly popular in computer vision. However, the number of known positive definite kernels on manifolds remain very limited. Furthermore, most kernels typically depend on at least one parameter that needs to be tuned for the problem at hand. A poor choice of kernel, or of parameter value, may yield significant performance drop-off.  ...	17
Mats Isaksson, Anders Eriksson, Saeid Nahavandi	2014/5/31	None	Abstract: Determining an analytical solution to the inverse kinematics problem for a parallel manipulator is typically a straightforward problem. However, lower mobility parallel manipulators with 2-5 degrees of freedom (DOFs) often suffer from an unwanted parasitic motion in one or more DOFs. For such manipulators, the inverse kinematics problem can be significantly more difficult. This paper contains an analysis of the inverse kinematics problem for a class of 3-DOF parallel manipulators with axis-symmetric arm systems. All  ...	7
Xuming He, Stephen Gould	2014	None	Abstract We address the problem of joint detection and segmentation of multiple object instances in an image, a key step towards scene understanding. Inspired by data-driven methods, we propose an exemplar-based approach to the task of instance segmentation, in which a set of reference image/shape masks is used to find multiple objects. We design a novel CRF framework that jointly models object appearance, shape deformation, and object occlusion. To tackle the challenging MAP inference problem, we derive an alternating  ...	23
Richard Hartley	2014/8/26	None	Abstract: Summary form only given. I will talk about recent results from a number of people in my group on Riemannian manifolds in computer vision. In many Vision problems Riemannian manifolds come up as a natural model. Data related to a problem can be naturally represented as a point on a Riemannian manifold. This talk will give an intuitive introduction to Riemannian manifolds, and show how they can be applied in many situations. Manifolds of interest include the manifold of Positive Definite matrices and the  ...	0
Mehrtash T Harandi, Mathieu Salzmann, Sadeep Jayasumana, Richard Hartley, Hongdong Li	2014/9/6	None	Abstract Modeling videos and image-sets as linear subspaces has proven beneficial for many visual recognition tasks. However, it also incurs challenges arising from the fact that linear subspaces do not obey Euclidean geometry, but lie on a special type of Riemannian manifolds known as Grassmannian. To leverage the techniques developed for Euclidean spaces (eg, support vector machines) with subspaces, several recent studies have proposed to embed the Grassmannian into a Hilbert space by making use of a positive definite  ...	41
Mehrtash T Harandi, Mathieu Salzmann, Richard Hartley	2014/9/6	None	Abstract Representing images and videos with Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices and considering the Riemannian geometry of the resulting space has proven beneficial for many recognition tasks. Unfortunately, computation on the Riemannian manifold of SPD matrices–especially of high-dimensional ones–comes at a high cost that limits the applicability of existing techniques. In this paper we introduce an approach that lets us handle high-dimensional SPD matrices by constructing a lower-dimensional, more  ...	70
Mehrtash Harandi, Mathieu Salzmann, Fatih Porikli	2014	None	Abstract We introduce an approach to computing and comparing Covariance Descriptors (CovDs) in infinite-dimensional spaces. CovDs have become increasingly popular to address classification problems in computer vision. While CovDs offer some robustness to measurement variations, they also throw away part of the information contained in the original data by only retaining the second-order statistics over the measurements. Here, we propose to overcome this limitation by first mapping the original data to a high- ...	40
Xufeng Guo, Simon Denman, Clinton Fookes, Luis Mejias, Sridha Sridharan	2014/11/25	None	Abstract: The commercialization of aerial image processing is highly dependent on the platforms such as UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles). However, the lack of an automated UAV forced landing site detection system has been identified as one of the main impediments to allow UAV flight over populated areas in civilian airspace. This article proposes a UAV forced landing site detection system that is based on machine learning approaches including the Gaussian Mixture Model and the Support Vector Machine. A  ...	4
Stephen Gould, Jiecheng Zhao, Xuming He, Yuhang Zhang	2014	None	Abstract We present a fast approximate nearest neighbor algorithm for semantic segmentation. Our algorithm builds a graph over superpixels from an annotated set of training images. Edges in the graph represent approximate nearest neighbors in feature space. At test time we match superpixels from a novel image to the training images by adding the novel image to the graph. A move-making search algorithm allows us to leverage the graph and image structure for finding matches. We then transfer labels from the  ...	29
Jason J Ford, Timothy L Molloy, Joanne L Hall	2014/7/7	None	Abstract: This paper investigates compressed sensing using hidden Markov models (HMMs) and hence provides an extension of recent single frame, bounded error sparse decoding problems into a class of sparse estimation problems containing both temporal evolution and stochastic aspects. This paper presents two optimal estimators for compressed HMMs. The impact of measurement compression on HMM filtering performance is experimentally examined in the context of an important image based aircraft target tracking application.  ...	1
Masoud Faraki, Mehrtash T Harandi, Fatih Porikli	2015/1/5	None	Abstract: This paper tackles the problem of categorizing materials and textures by exploiting the second order statistics. To this end, we introduce the Extrinsic Vector of Locally Aggregated Descriptors (E-VLAD), a method to combine local and structured descriptors into a unified vector representation where each local descriptor is a Covariance Descriptor (CovD). In doing so, we make use of an accelerated method of obtaining a visual codebook where each atom is itself a CovD. We will then introduce an efficient way of aggregating  ...	5
Anders Eriksson, Mats Isaksson, Tat-Jun Chin	2015/1/5	None	Abstract: Identifying the parameters of a model such that it best fits an observed set of data points is fundamental to the majority of problems in computer vision. This task is particularly demanding when portions of the data has been corrupted by gross outliers, measurements that are not explained by the assumed distributions. In this paper we present a novel method that uses the Least Quantile of Squares (LQS) estimator, a well known but computationally demanding high-breakdown estimator with several appealing theoretical properties. The  ...	2
Anders Eriksson, Mats Isaksson	2014	None	Abstract In this paper we study optimization methods for minimizing large-scale pseudoconvex L_infinity problems in multiview geometry. We present a novel algorithm for solving this class of problem based on proximal splitting methods. We provide a brief derivation of the proposed method along with a general convergence analysis. The resulting meta-algorithm requires very little effort in terms of implementation and instead makes use of existing advanced solvers for non-linear optimization. Preliminary experiments on a  ...	3
Andrew English, Patrick Ross, David Ball, Peter Corke	2014	None	Abstract: This paper describes a novel vision based texture tracking method to guide autonomous vehicles in agricultural fields where the crop rows are challenging to detect. Existing methods require sufficient visual difference between the crop and soil for segmentation, or explicit knowledge of the structure of the crop rows. This method works by extracting and tracking the direction and lateral offset of the dominant parallel texture in a simulated overhead view of the scene and hence abstracts away crop-specific details  ...	26
Yuchao Dai, Hongdong Li	2014/11/25	None	Abstract: Low rank method or rank-minimization has received considerable attention from recent computer vision community. Due to the inherent computational complexity of rank problems, the non-convex rank function is often relaxed to its convex relaxation, ie the nuclear norm. Thanks to recent progress made in the filed of compressive sensing (CS), vision researchers who are practicing CS are fully aware, and conscious, of the convex relaxation gap, as well as under which condition (eg Restricted Isometry Property) the  ...	2
Yuejie Chi, Fatih Porikli	2014/8	None	Abstract: Recent advances have shown a great potential to explore collaborative representations of test samples in a dictionary composed of training samples from all classes in multi-class recognition including sparse representations. In this paper, we present two multi-class classification algorithms that make use of multiple collaborative representations in their formulations, and demonstrate performance gain of exploring this extra degree of freedom. We first present the Collaborative Representation Optimized  ...	21
Zetao Chen, Adam Jacobson, Uğur M Erdem, Michael E Hasselmo, Michael Milford	2014/5/31	None	Abstract: This paper presents a novel place recognition algorithm inspired by the recent discovery of overlapping and multi-scale spatial maps in the rodent brain. We mimic this hierarchical framework by training arrays of Support Vector Machines to recognize places at multiple spatial scales. Place match hypotheses are then cross-validated across all spatial scales, a process which combines the spatial specificity of the finest spatial map with the consensus provided by broader mapping scales. Experiments on three real-world  ...	7
Zetao Chen, Obadiah Lam, Adam Jacobson, Michael Milford	2014/11/6	None	Abstract: Recently Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance on various classification tasks. In this paper, we present for the first time a place recognition technique based on CNN models, by combining the powerful features learnt by CNNs with a spatial and sequential filter. Applying the system to a 70 km benchmark place recognition dataset we achieve a 75% increase in recall at 100% precision, significantly outperforming all previous state of the art techniques. We also  ...	37
Bineng Zhong, Hongxun Yao, Sheng Chen, Rongrong Ji, Tat-Jun Chin, Hanzi Wang	2014/3/31	None	Abstract Notwithstanding many years of progress, visual tracking is still a difficult but important problem. Since most top-performing tracking methods have their strengths and weaknesses and are suited for handling only a certain type of variation, one of the next challenges is to integrate all these methods and address the problem of long-term persistent tracking in ever-changing environments. Towards this goal, we consider visual tracking in a novel weakly supervised learning scenario where (possibly noisy) labels but no ground  ...	58
Julio Zaragoza, Tat-Jun Chin, Quoc-Huy Tran, Michael S Brown, David Suter	2014	None	Abstract We investigate projective estimation under model inadequacies, ie, when the underpinning assumptions of the projective model are not fully satisfied by the data. We focus on the task of image stitching which is customarily solved by estimating a projective warp-a model that is justified when the scene is planar or when the views differ purely by rotation. Such conditions are easily violated in practice, and this yields stitching results with ghosting artefacts that necessitate the usage of deghosting algorithms. To this end we  ...	108
Jin Yu, Anders Eriksson, Tat-Jun Chin, David Suter	2011	None	Abstract This paper proposes a novel adversarial optimization approach to efficient outlier removal in computer vision. We characterize the outlier removal problem as a game that involves two players of conflicting interests, namely, model optimizer and outliers. Such an adversarial view not only brings new insights into some existing methods, but also gives rise to a general optimization framework that provably unifies them. Under the proposed framework, we develop a new outlier removal approach that is able to offer a much  ...	27
Yan Yan, Hanzi Wang, David Suter	2014/11/30	None	Abstract In this paper, we propose an effective feature extraction algorithm, called Multi-Subregion based Correlation Filter Bank (MS-CFB), for robust face recognition. MS-CFB combines the benefits of global-based and local-based feature extraction algorithms, where multiple correlation filters corresponding to different face subregions are jointly designed to optimize the overall correlation outputs. Furthermore, we reduce the computational complexity of MS-CFB by designing the correlation filter bank in the spatial domain and  ...	20
Yan Yan, Chunhua Shen, Hanzi Wang	2014/8/1	None	Abstract: We propose an efficient approach to semidefinite spectral clustering (SSC), which addresses the Frobenius normalization with the positive semidefinite (psd) constraint for spectral clustering. Compared with the original Frobenius norm approximation-based algorithm, the proposed algorithm can more accurately find the closest doubly stochastic approximation to the affinity matrix by considering the psd constraint. In this paper, SSC is formulated as a semidefinite programming (SDP) problem. In order to solve the high  ...	7
Michael David Warren	2015	None	This thesis explored the utility of long-range stereo visual odometry for application on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. Novel parameterisations and initialisation routines were developed for the long-range case of stereo visual odometry and new optimisation techniques were implemented to improve the robustness of visual odometry in this difficult scenario. In doing so, the applications of stereo visual odometry were expanded and shown to perform adequately in situations that were previously unworkable.	1
Xiaoqin Wang, Y Ahmet Şekercioğlu, Tom Drummond	2014/12/26	None	Abstract: We present a new vision based cooperative pose estimation scheme for systems of mobile robots equipped with RGB-D cameras. We first model a multi-robot system as an edge-weighted graph. Then, based on this model, and by using the real-time color and depth data, the robots with shared field-of-views estimate their relative poses in pairwise. The system does not need the existence of a single common view shared by all robots, and it works in 3D scenes without any specific calibration pattern or landmark. The proposed  ...	6
Lei Wang, Luping Zhou, Chunhua Shen, Lingqiao Liu, Huan Liu	2013	None	Abstract: In image recognition with the bag-of-features model, a small-sized visual codebook is usually preferred to obtain a low-dimensional histogram representation and high computational efficiency. Such a visual codebook has to be discriminative enough to achieve excellent recognition performance. To create a compact and discriminative codebook, in this paper we propose to merge the visual words in a large-sized initial codebook by maximally preserving class separability. We first show that this results in a  ...	12
Quoc-Huy Tran, Tat-Jun Chin, Wojciech Chojnacki, David Suter	2014/1/1	None	Abstract When sampling minimal subsets for robust parameter estimation, it is commonly known that obtaining an all-inlier minimal subset is not sufficient; the points therein should also have a large spatial extent. This paper investigates a theoretical basis behind this principle, based on a little known result which expresses the least squares regression as a weighted linear combination of all possible minimal subset estimates. It turns out that the weight of a minimal subset estimate is directly related to the span of the associated points.  ...	6
Zygmunt L Szpak, Wojciech Chojnacki, Anders Eriksson, Anton van den Hengel	2014/8/31	None	Abstract Two images of a scene consisting of multiple flat surfaces are related by a collection of homography matrices. Practitioners typically estimate these homographies separately thereby violating inherent inter-homography constraints that arise naturally out of the rigid geometry of the scene. We demonstrate that through a suitable choice of parametrisation multiple homographies can be jointly estimated in a manner so as to satisfy all inter-homography constraints. Unlike the cost functions used previously for solving this problem ...	5
Z. L. Szpak, W Chojnacki, van den Hengel A.	2014/9/25	None	Abstract A simple and fast ellipse estimation method is presented based on optimisation of the Sampson distance serving as a measure of the quality of fit between a candidate ellipse and data points. Generation of ellipses, not just conics, as estimates is ensured through the use of a parametrisation of the set of all ellipses. Optimisation of the Sampson distance is performed with the aid of a custom variant of the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm. The method is supplemented with a measure of uncertainty of an ellipse fit in two closely  ...	8
Dennis Strelow, Qifan Wang, Luo Si, Anders Eriksson	2016/9/1	None	Abstract: Wiberg matrix factorization breaks a matrix $ Y $ into low-rank factors $ U $ and $ V $ by solving for $ V $ in closed form given $ U $, linearizing $ V (U) $ about $ U $, and iteratively minimizing $|| Y-UV (U)|| _2 $ with respect to $ U $ only. This approach factors the matrix while effectively removing $ V $ from the minimization. Recently Eriksson and van den Hengel extended this approach to $ L_1 $, minimizing $|| Y-UV (U)|| _1 $. We generalize their approach beyond factorization to minimize $|| Yf (U, V)|| _1 $ for more  ...	1
Fumin Shen, Chunhua Shen, Rhys Hill, Anton van den Hengel, Zhenmin Tang	2014/9/30	None	Abstract Minimization of the L∞ L∞ norm, which can be viewed as approximately solving the non-convex least median estimation problem, is a powerful method for outlier removal and hence robust regression. However, current techniques for solving the problem at the heart of L∞ L∞ norm minimization are slow, and therefore cannot be scaled to large problems. A new method for the minimization of the L∞ L∞ norm is presented here, which provides a speedup of multiple orders of magnitude for data with high dimension. This  ...	11
Chunhua Shen, Guosheng Lin, Anton van den Hengel	2013/2/14	None	Abstract: Boosting is a method for learning a single accurate predictor by linearly combining a set of less accurate weak learners. Recently, structured learning has found many applications in computer vision. Inspired by structured support vector machines (SSVM), here we propose a new boosting algorithm for structured output prediction, which we refer to as StructBoost. StructBoost supports nonlinear structured learning by combining a set of weak structured learners. As SSVM generalizes SVM, our StructBoost generalizes  ...	13
Chunhua Shen, Junae Kim, Fayao Liu, Lei Wang, Anton van den Hengel	2014	None	Abstract: Distance metric learning is of fundamental interest in machine learning because the employed distance metric can significantly affect the performance of many learning methods. Quadratic Mahalanobis metric learning is a popular approach to the problem, but typically requires solving a semidefinite programming (SDP) problem, which is computationally expensive. The worst case complexity of solving an SDP problem involving a matrix variable of size D× D with O (D) linear constraints is about O (D 6.5) using interior- ...	16
Seyed Hamid Rezatofighi, Stephen Gould, Ba-Ngu Vo, Katarina Mele, Richard Hartley	2015/1/12	None	Abstract: Quantitative analysis of the dynamics of tiny cellular and sub-cellular structures, known as particles, in time-lapse cell microscopy sequences requires the development of a reliable multi-target tracking method capable of tracking numerous similar targets in the presence of high levels of noise, high target density, complex motion patterns and intricate interactions. In this paper, we propose a framework for tracking these structures based on the random finite set Bayesian filtering framework. We focus on challenging biological  ...	21
Carl Yuheng Ren, Victor Prisacariu, Ian Reid	2014/2/1	None	Abstract We propose a novel regression based framework that uses online learned shape information to reconstruct occluded object contours. Our key insight is to regress the global, coarse, properties of shape from its local properties, ie its details. We do this by representing shapes using their 2D discrete cosine transforms and by regressing low frequency from high frequency harmonics. We learn this regression model using Locally Weighted Projection Regression which expedites online, incremental learning. After sufficient observation of a  ...	9
Pulak Purkait, Tat-Jun Chin, Alireza Sadri, David Suter	2016/10/4	None	Abstract: The extension of conventional clustering to hypergraph clustering, which involves higher order similarities instead of pairwise similarities, is increasingly gaining attention in computer vision. This is due to the fact that many clustering problems require an affinity measure that must involve a subset of data of size more than two. In the context of hypergraph clustering, the calculation of such higher order similarities on data subsets gives rise to hyperedges. Almost all previous work on hypergraph clustering in computer vision,  ...	14
Trung T Pham, Tat-Jun Chin, Jin Yu, David Suter	2014/8	None	Abstract: Random hypothesis generation is central to robust geometric model fitting in computer vision. The predominant technique is to randomly sample minimal subsets of the data, and hypothesize the geometric models from the selected subsets. While taking minimal subsets increases the chance of successively “hitting” inliers in a sample, hypotheses fitted on minimal subsets may be severely biased due to the influence of measurement noise, even if the minimal subsets contain purely inliers. In this paper we propose Random  ...	61
Trung Thanh Pham, Tat-Jun Chin, Konrad Schindler, David Suter	2014/10	None	Abstract: Recent works on multimodel fitting are often formulated as an energy minimization task, where the energy function includes fitting error and regularization terms, such as low-level spatial smoothness and model complexity. In this paper, we introduce a novel energy with high-level geometric priors that consider interactions between geometric models, such that certain preferred model configurations may be induced. We argue that in many applications, such prior geometric properties are available and should be fruitfully  ...	11
Sakrapee Paisitkriangkrai, Chunhua Shen, Qinfeng Shi, Anton van den Hengel	2014/4	None	Abstract: We propose a novel boosting approach to multiclass classification problems, in which multiple classes are distinguished by a set of random projection matrices in essence. The approach uses random projections to alleviate the proliferation of binary classifiers typically required to perform multiclass classification. The result is a multiclass classifier with a single vector-valued parameter, irrespective of the number of classes involved. Two variants of this approach are proposed. The first method randomly projects the original  ...	9
Sakrapee Paisitkriangkrai, Chunhua Shen, Anton van den Hengel	2014/8	None	Abstract: Cascade classifiers are one of the most important contributions to real-time object detection. Nonetheless, there are many challenging problems arising in training cascade detectors. One common issue is that the node classifier is trained with a symmetric classifier. Having a low misclassification error rate does not guarantee an optimal node learning goal in cascade classifiers, ie, an extremely high detection rate with a moderate false positive rate. In this work, we present a new approach to train an effective node classifier in a  ...	3
Sakrapee Paisitkriangkrai, Chunhua Shen, Anton van den Hengel	2014/5	None	Abstract: We present a scalable and effective classification model to train multiclass boosting for multiclass classification problems. A direct formulation of multiclass boosting had been introduced in the past in the sense that it directly maximized the multiclass margin. The major problem of that approach is its high computational complexity during training, which hampers its application to real-world problems. In this paper, we propose a scalable and simple stagewise multiclass boosting method which also directly maximizes the multiclass  ...	11
Sakrapee Paisitkriangkrai, Chunhua Shen, Anton van den Hengel	2014/9	None	Abstract: The use of high-dimensional features has become a normal practice in many computer vision applications. The large dimension of these features is a limiting factor upon the number of data points, which may be effectively stored and processed, however. We address this problem by developing a novel approach to learning a compact binary encoding, which exploits both pairwise proximity and class-label information on training data set. Exploiting this extra information apairwise proximity and class-label information on  ...	2
Yan Niu, Anthony Dick, Michael Brooks	2014/1	None	Abstract: This paper proposes a new image signature, called Compass Rose, which is particularly suited to optical flow computation. It is differentiable, fast to compute, and robust to additive illumination changes, translation, and fast rotation. We design a sparse flow computation system based on the invariance of the Compass Rose signatures. This is then extended to dense motion estimation by the addition of an optional diffusion step. Quantitative testing on several benchmark sequences shows the Compass Rose attains  ...	4
Peer Neubert, Niko Sünderhauf, Peter Protzel	2015/7/31	None	Abstract Changing environments pose a serious problem to current robotic systems aiming at long term operation under varying seasons or local weather conditions. This paper is built on our previous work where we propose to learn to predict the changes in an environment. Our key insight is that the occurring scene changes are in part systematic, repeatable and therefore predictable. The goal of our work is to support existing approaches to place recognition by learning how the visual appearance of an environment changes over time  ...	31
Michael Milford, Eleonora Vig, Walter Scheirer, David Cox	2014/9/1	None	Abstract For robots operating in outdoor environments, a number of factors, including weather, time of day, rough terrain, high speeds, and hardware limitations, make performing vision-based simultaneous localization and mapping with current techniques infeasible due to factors such as image blur and/or underexposure, especially on smaller platforms and low-cost hardware. In this paper, we present novel visual place-recognition and odometry techniques that address the challenges posed by low lighting, perceptual change, and low ...	19
Michael Milford, Ruth Schulz	2014/11/5	None	Mobile robots and animals alike must effectively navigate their environments in order to achieve their goals. For animals goal-directed navigation facilitates finding food, seeking shelter or migration; similarly robots perform goal-directed navigation to find a charging station, get out of the rain or guide a person to a destination. This similarity in tasks extends to the environment as well; increasingly, mobile robots are operating in the same underwater, ground and aerial environments that animals do. Yet despite these  ...	11
Aaron Mcfadyen, Peter Corke, Luis Mejias	2014/12	None	Abstract: This paper deals with constrained image-based visual servoing of circular and conical spiral motion about an unknown object approximating a single image point feature. Effective visual control of such trajectories has many applications for small unmanned aerial vehicles, including surveillance and inspection, forced landing (homing), and collision avoidance. A spherical camera model is used to derive a novel visual-predictive controller (VPC) using stability-based design methods for general nonlinear model-predictive  ...	7
AP Bradley Z Lu, G Carneiro	2015/1/9	None	Abstract: In this paper, we present an improved algorithm for the segmentation of cytoplasm and nuclei from clumps of overlapping cervical cells. This problem is notoriously difficult because of the degree of overlap among cells, the poor contrast of cell cytoplasm and the presence of mucus, blood, and inflammatory cells. Our methodology addresses these issues by utilizing a joint optimization of multiple level set functions, where each function represents a cell within a clump, that have both unary (intracell) and pairwise (intercell) constraints.  ...	33
Yanting Lu, Liantao Wang, Jianfeng Lu, Jingyu Yang, Chunhua Shen	2014/11/30	None	Abstract Multiple kernel clustering (MKC), which performs kernel-based data fusion for data clustering, is an emerging topic. It aims at solving clustering problems with multiple cues. Most MKC methods usually extend existing clustering methods with a multiple kernel learning (MKL) setting. In this paper, we propose a novel MKC method that is different from those popular approaches. Centered kernel alignment—an effective kernel evaluation measure—is employed in order to unify the two tasks of clustering and MKL into a single  ...	19
Junbin Liu, Sridha Sridharan, Clinton Fookes, Tim Wark	2014/1	None	Abstract: The selection of optimal camera configurations (camera locations, orientations, etc.) for multi-camera networks remains an unsolved problem. Previous approaches largely focus on proposing various objective functions to achieve different tasks. Most of them, however, do not generalize well to large scale networks. To tackle this, we propose a statistical framework of the problem as well as propose a trans-dimensional simulated annealing algorithm to effectively deal with it. We compare our approach with a state-of- ...	14
Fayao Liu, Luping Zhou, Chunhua Shen, Jianping Yin	2014/5	None	Abstract: To achieve effective and efficient detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD), many machine learning methods have been introduced into this realm. However, the general case of limited training samples, as well as different feature representations typically makes this problem challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel multiple kernel-learning framework to combine multimodal features for AD classification, which is scalable and easy to implement. Contrary to the usual way of solving the problem in the dual, we look at the  ...	24
Yao Li, Wenjing Jia, Chunhua Shen, Anton van den Hengel	2014/4	None	Abstract: Text in an image provides vital information for interpreting its contents, and text in a scene can aid a variety of tasks from navigation to obstacle avoidance and odometry. Despite its value, however, detecting general text in images remains a challenging research problem. Motivated by the need to consider the widely varying forms of natural text, we propose a bottom-up approach to the problem, which reflects the characterness of an image region. In this sense, our approach mirrors the move from saliency detection methods to  ...	38

In this paper, we propose a context-aware hypergraph similarity measure (CAHSM), which leads to robust spectral clustering in the case of noisy data. We construct three types of hypergraphs-the pairwise hypergraph, the k-nearest-neighbor (kNN) hypergraph, and the high-order over-clustering hypergraph. The pairwise hypergraph captures the pairwise similarity of data points; the kNNhypergraph captures the neighborhood of each point; and the clustering  ...	24
Worapan Kusakunniran, Qiang Wu, Jian Zhang, Hongdong Li, Liang Wang	2014/2	None	Abstract: Human gait is an important biometric feature, which can be used to identify a person remotely. However, view change can cause significant difficulties for gait recognition because it will alter available visual features for matching substantially. Moreover, it is observed that different parts of gait will be affected differently by view change. By exploring relations between two gaits from two different views, it is also observed that a part of gait in one view is more related to a typical part than any other parts of gait in another view.

Sadeep Jayasumana, Richard Hartley, Mathieu Salzmann, Hongdong Li, Mehrtash Harandi	2015	None	Abstract: In this paper, we develop an approach to exploiting kernel methods with manifold-valued data. In many computer vision problems, the data can be naturally represented as points on a Riemannian manifold. Due to the non-Euclidean geometry of Riemannian manifolds, usual Euclidean computer vision and machine learning algorithms yield inferior results on such data. In this paper, we define Gaussian radial basis function (RBF)-based positive definite kernels on manifolds that permit us to embed a given manifold with a  ...	45

Mehrtash Harandi, Richard Hartley, Chunhua Shen, Brian Lovell, Conrad Sanderson	2015/9/1	None	Abstract Sparsity-based representations have recently led to notable results in various visual recognition tasks. In a separate line of research, Riemannian manifolds have been shown useful for dealing with features and models that do not lie in Euclidean spaces. With the aim of building a bridge between the two realms, we address the problem of sparse coding and dictionary learning in Grassmann manifolds, ie, the space of linear subspaces. To this end, we propose to embed Grassmann manifolds into the space of symmetric matrices by an  ...	27
Mehrtash T Harandi, Richard Hartley, Brian Lovell, Conrad Sanderson	2016/6	None	Abstract: This paper introduces sparse coding and dictionary learning for symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices, which are often used in machine learning, computer vision, and related areas. Unlike traditional sparse coding schemes that work in vector spaces, in this paper, we discuss how SPD matrices can be described by sparse combination of dictionary atoms, where the atoms are also SPD matrices. We propose to seek sparse coding by embedding the space of SPD matrices into the Hilbert spaces through two types of the  ...	25

In computer vision an important class of constraints encode a preference for label consistency over large sets of pixels and can be modeled using higher-order terms known as lower linear envelope potentials. In this paper we develop an algorithm for learning the parameters of binary Markov random fields with weighted lower  ...	1

Other than using the fundamental low-order linear combination model assumption, our method does not assume any extra prior knowledge either about the non-rigid structure or about the camera motions. Yet, it works effectively and reliably, producing optimal results, and not suffering from the inherent basis ambiguity issue which plagued most conventional NRSfM factorization methods. Our  ...	107

However, it is difficult to measure image content similarity due to visual changes caused by varying viewpoint and environment. In this paper, we propose a simple, efficient method to more effectively measure content similarity from image measurements. Our method is based on the ranking information available from existing retrieval systems. We observe that images within the set which, when used as  ...	24

This paper considers models composed of rotation and focal length, which typically occurs in the context of panoramic imaging. An efficient approach consists in computing the underlying model such that the number of inliers is maximized. The most popular tool for inlier set maximization must be RANSAC and its numerous variants. While they can provide interesting results, they are not guaranteed to return the globally optimal  ...	6
Thalaiyasingam Ajanthan, Richard Hartley, Mathieu Salzmann, Hongdong Li	2015/6	None	Abstract While widely acknowledged as highly effective in computer vision, multi-label MRFs with non-convex priors are difficult to optimize. To tackle this, we introduce an algorithm that iteratively approximates the original energy with an appropriately weighted surrogate energy that is easier to minimize. Our algorithm guarantees that the original energy decreases at each iteration. In particular, we consider the scenario where the global minimizer of the weighted surrogate energy can be obtained by a multi-label graph cut algorithm, and  ...	5
Yanzhi Chen, Anthony Dick, Xi Li, Rhys Hill	2014/11/1	None	Abstract We propose a simple but effective re-ranking method for improving the results of object retrieval. Our method considers the contextual information embedded in a dataset. This is based on the observation that if there are multiple images containing the same object in a dataset, then these images can often be grouped into clusters. We make the following two contributions. Firstly, we gain this contextual information by a random dimension partition of the dataset. This enables online query model expansion if needed. Secondly,  ...	0
Qian Chen, Gustavo Carneiro	2014/9/6	None	Abstract. Artistic image understanding is an interdisciplinary research field of increasing importance for the computer vision and art history communities. One of the goals of this field is the implementation of a system that can automatically retrieve and annotate artistic images. The best approach in the field explores the artistic influence among different artistic images using graph-based learning methodologies that take into consideration appearance and label similarities, but the current state-ofthe-art results indicate that there seems to be  ...	0
Cesar Cadena, Anthony Dick, Ian D Reid	2015/5/26	None	Abstract: We propose a semantic scene understanding system that is suitable for real robotic operations. The system solves different tasks (semantic segmentation and object detections) in an opportunistic and distributed fashion but still allows communication between modules to improve their respective performances. We propose the use of the semantic space to improve specific out-of-the-box object detectors and an update model to take the evidence from different detection into account in the semantic segmentation process. Our proposal  ...	8
Rafael Berkvens, Adam Jacobson, Michael Milford, Herbert Peremans, Maarten Weyn	2014/9/16	None	Abstract: Wi-Fi is a commonly available source of localization information in urban environments but is challenging to integrate into conventional mapping architectures. Current state of the art probabilistic Wi-Fi SLAM algorithms are limited by spatial resolution and an inability to remove the accumulation of rotational error, inherent limitations of the Wi-Fi architecture. In this paper we leverage the low quality sensory requirements and coarse metric properties of RatSLAM to localize using Wi-Fi fingerprints. To further improve  ...	8
Tuan Anh Ngo, Gustavo Carneiro	2014	None	Abstract We propose a new fully automated non-rigid segmentation approach based on the distance regularized level set method that is initialized and constrained by the results of a structured inference using deep belief networks. This recently proposed level-set formulation achieves reasonably accurate results in several segmentation problems, and has the advantage of eliminating periodic re-initializations during the optimization process, and as a result it avoids numerical errors. Nevertheless, when applied to challenging problems,  ...	16
Kaneswaran Anantharajah, ZongYuan Ge, Chris McCool, Simon Denman, Clinton Fookes, Peter Corke, Dian Tjondronegoro, Sridha Sridharan	2014/3/24	None	Abstract: Object classification is plagued by the issue of session variation. Session variation describes any variation that makes one instance of an object look different to another, for instance due to pose or illumination variation. Recent work in the challenging task of face verification has shown that session variability modelling provides a mechanism to overcome some of these limitations. However, for computer vision purposes, it has only been applied in the limited setting of face verification. In this paper we propose a local region based  ...	5
Chunhua Shen, Anton van den Hengel	2014	None	Background The role of a sensor element is to measure incident irradiance and record that quantity as an image intensity value. However, physical constraints limit the maximum irradiance that can be measured for a given camera setting. In the absence of noise, the mapping from irradiance to image intensity is fully described by the radiometric response function, a monotonically increasing function whose range is restricted by the maximum irradiance. Pixels whose intensity corresponds to this maximum are known as saturated.  ...	0
Anthony Dick, Anton van den Hengel, Henry Detmold	2014	None	Abstract In this chapter we describe the problem of camera network topology mapping, which is a critical precursor to person re-identification in large camera networks. After surveying previous approaches to this problem we describe “exclusion”, a practical, robust method for deriving a topology estimate that scales to thousands of cameras. We then consider re-identification within such networks by modelling and matching target appearance. By combining a simple appearance model with the topology estimate  ...	2
Jean-Charles Bazin, Yongduek Seo, Richard Hartley, Marc Pollefeys	2014/9/6	None	Abstract Identifying inliers and outliers among data is a fundamental problem for model estimation. This paper considers models composed of rotation and focal length, which typically occurs in the context of panoramic imaging. An efficient approach consists in computing the underlying model such that the number of inliers is maximized. The most popular tool for inlier set maximization must be RANSAC and its numerous variants. While they can provide interesting results, they are not guaranteed to return the globally optimal  ...	6
